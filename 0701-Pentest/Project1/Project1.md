## Objective
Testing Password Policy Resilience with PassGAN. Use OSINT to customize and augment PassGAN-generated wordlists.

## Setup

1. Lab environment (e.g., Kali Linux attacker VM, Windows/Linux target VM).

2. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/brannondorsey/PassGAN.git Use the pretrained model.

3. Collect password hashes from your test system(your own only) or use https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases. Use standard hash formats supported by hashcat/john (e.g., NTLM, SHA-512, bcrypt).

4. Generate Wordlist with PassGAN. Attempt cracking with https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat

5. Enrich your data with OSINT (only within your team) you can use tools like https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester. Use PassGAN + OSINT enhanced wordlist to crack the pawword

6. **Deliverables**
- How many hashes cracked? Comparison in percentage between PassGAN and PassGAN + OSINT. 
- Simple vs. complex passwords cracking time comparison graph for both cases.
- A pentesting report with recommandations for stronger password policy.
