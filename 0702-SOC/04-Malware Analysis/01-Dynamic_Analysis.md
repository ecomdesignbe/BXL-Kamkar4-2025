## Tasks

1. Local dynamic analysis with REMnux. Controlled execution in REMnux you can use use samples from https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo . Use procmon-like tooling (procmon/linux equivalents), strace, lsof, and inotify to record file/process activity.
Capture network traffic with tcpdump/wireshark during execution. Produce process tree timeline, list of created/modified files, and a pcap file. 
After running a sample, capture a full memory image (using LiME/volatility-compatible format).
Use https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility to extract running processes, network connections, and a dumped suspicious process memory region. Provide the commands used and a short list of 5 extracted artifacts from memory.
API & sandbox evasion detection.Run the sample with environment changes: disable network, enable network, change locale, and enable user interaction. Document behavioral differences between runs â€” list at least 3 differences and hypothesize about sandbox-evasion techniques used.

2. Register and prepare accounts. Create accounts on https://hybrid-analysis.com/ and https://any.run/. Verify API access for Hybrid-Analysis (obtain API key).

3. Static triage of a provided sample ex. sample A use https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo. Compute hashes (MD5/SHA1/SHA256), file type, embedded strings, and import table. Identify packers, certificates, and compiler/toolchain artifacts.Create triage summary (hashes, notable strings, suspected capabilities).

4. YARA hunting. Write 2 YARA rules targeting (a) a unique string pattern found and (b) an import/API usage pattern.

5. Online sandbox submission & analysis. Submit sample A and sample B to Hybrid-Analysis. Submit both samples (one at a time). Retrieve the full Hybrid-Analysis report. Extract and list three high-confidence indicators (domains, IPs, file paths) from each report. Run sample B interactively on Any.Run, exercise all available UI interaction features (simulate user clicks, network, etc.). Capture the timeline of spawned processes and any screenshots at notable timestamps. Export the session and include the session ID in your deliverables.

6. Cuckoo sandbox deployment & customizations. Deploy Cuckoo (single machine or distributed) and integrate REMnux tools:
Install and configure Cuckoo, submit at least one sample to it. Add one custom analyzer or signature to Cuckoo (e.g., a Python analyzer to extract a specific registry key or file). Run a sample and collect the Cuckoo report. Document how your custom analyzer is invoked. Compare results for the same sample across Cuckoo and Hybrid-Analysis.
Produce a comparison table showing process names, network callbacks, persistence mechanisms, and discrepancies.
