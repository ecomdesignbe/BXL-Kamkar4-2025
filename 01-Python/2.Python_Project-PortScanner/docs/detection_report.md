# Port Scanner Detection Report

## Overview
This report analyzes the port scanning tool implemented across multiple Python modules.

## Module Analysis

### scan_module.py
- Main executable module containing core scanning functionality
- Features:
  - ASCII art logo for Duck Slouster
  - Team member credits
  - Logging setup with detailed configuration
  - Website/IP scanning capabilities
  - Port scanning implementation
  - User interface for input handling

Key Functions:
- setup_logging(): Configures logging with detailed formatting
- scan_website(): Resolves website URLs to IP addresses
- find_port(): Performs port scanning on specified ranges
- main(): Handles program flow and user interaction

### validation.py
- Input validation and verification module
- Features:
  - IP address validation
  - Port range validation
  - URL validation and resolution

Key Functions:
- validate_ip_address(): Verifies IP address format
- validate_port_range(): Validates single ports and port ranges
- validate_url(): Validates and resolves URLs to IP addresses

### port_scanner.py
- Same goal and use the same function as scan_moudle but uses command line
- exemple: `python port-scanner-team/port_scanner.py --url hackthissite.org --ports 80-443`

## Security Features
1. Input Validation:
   - Comprehensive IP address format checking
   - Port range verification (1-65535)
   - URL format validation and resolution

2. Error Handling:
   - Socket connection error handling
   - Hostname resolution error handling
   - Keyboard interrupt handling
   - Server response verification

3. Logging:
   - Detailed logging of all operations
   - Timestamp recording
   - Error and warning documentation
   - Separate log files for different purposes

## Limitations and Recommendations
1. Security:
   - Add rate limiting for port scanning
   - Implement timeout configurations
   - Add user authentication

2. Features:
   - Implement concurrent scanning
   - Add service detection
   - Include banner grabbing
   - Add scan result analysis

3. Code Structure:
   - Implement port_scanner.py functionality
   - Add more documentation
   - Include unit tests
   - Consider adding configuration file support
