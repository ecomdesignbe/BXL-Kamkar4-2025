# Port Scanner Testing Report

## Overview
This document details the testing performed on the Port Scanner application components including the scan module, validation module, and main port scanner implementation.

## Components Tested

### 1. scan_module.py
#### Unit Tests
- Verified scan initialization with valid IP addresses and port ranges
- Tested TCP connection attempts to open/closed ports
- Validated timeout handling for unresponsive hosts
- Confirmed proper socket closure after scan completion

#### Results
- All core scanning functions operate as expected
- Proper error handling for invalid connections
- Memory management working correctly with socket cleanup

### 2. validation.py
#### Unit Tests
- Tested IP address format validation
- Verified port range validation (1-65535)
- Checked input sanitization for malicious strings
- Validated handling of invalid input formats

#### Results
- Successfully catches malformed IP addresses
- Correctly validates port range boundaries
- Properly sanitizes user input
- Error messages are clear and informative

### 3. port_scanner.py
#### Integration Tests
- Tested end-to-end scanning workflow
- Verified concurrent scanning functionality
- Validated results output formatting
- Tested command line argument parsing

#### Results
- Successfully integrates all modules
- Concurrent scanning performs efficiently
- Output is properly formatted and readable
- Command line interface works as designed

## Performance Testing
- Tested scanning speed with various port ranges
- Measured memory usage during large scans
- Verified timeout settings effectiveness
- Tested concurrent connection handling

## Security Testing
- Validated input sanitization
- Tested against common injection attempts
- Verified proper error handling
- Confirmed no sensitive data exposure

## Issues and Resolutions
1. Memory Usage
   - Identified memory leak in long-running scans
   - Resolved by implementing proper socket cleanup

2. Timeout Handling
   - Initial timeout values caused slow scans
   - Optimized timeout settings for better performance

## Recommendations
1. Add automated regression testing
2. Implement additional error logging
3. Consider adding rate limiting for large scans
4. Add support for service version detection

## Conclusion
The Port Scanner application passes all critical test cases and performs reliably. The codebase demonstrates good error handling and input validation. Minor optimizations could further improve performance and functionality.
